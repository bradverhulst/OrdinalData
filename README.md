Verhulst, B., & Neale, M.C. (Under Review) Best Practices for Binary or Ordinal Data Analysis.

In the paper, we conduct a series of simualation studies to assess the bias that accrues in estimates of Pearson product-moment correlations when they are applied to ordinal data.

All of the simulation scripts that were used in the paper are provided, including scripts to construct the figures.

As we cannot possibly anticipate every combination of simulated correlations, number of categories, threshold values, the included R function simulates data, then calculates Pearson product-moment, logit and maximum likelihood correlations and odds ratios.
